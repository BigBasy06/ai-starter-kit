## 🎥 Capability Showcase
*The video below demonstrates **Sigma AI**, a production-grade implementation built using this exact architecture. It features advanced branding, custom logic, and latency simulation.*

## 🚀 The Nexus Template (What You Get)
This repo provides the **clean, deployment-ready** foundation. It strips away the specific "Sigma" branding and mock data, giving you a universal socket to plug into OpenAI.

*   **🧠 GPT-4o Vision Native:** Drag & Drop images or PDFs. The AI "sees" and analyzes them.
*   **⚡ Real-Time Streaming:** Token-by-token generation (no loading spinners).
*   **🎨 Cyber-Minimalist UI:** Pre-styled CSS theme (dark mode optimized).
*   **🧮 LaTeX Engine:** Automatically renders complex math/physics equations.
*   **🛡️ Secure Auth:** Built-in API Key handling for safe public demos.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nexus-ai-template.git
cd nexus-ai-template
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Engine
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### 3. Activate
The app will launch in your browser. Enter your **OpenAI API Key** in the sidebar to ignite the engine.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### PDF Support (Optional)
This template supports PDF analysis using `pdf2image`.
*   **Mac/Linux:** Usually works out of the box.
*   **Windows:** You must install [Poppler](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/) and add it to your PATH.
*   *Fallback:* If Poppler is missing, the app gracefully disables PDF support but keeps Image Vision active.

### Customizing the "Soul"
Edit `system_instruction.md` to change the AI's persona.
*   *Current:* "Academic Tutor"
*   *Change to:* "Code Reviewer", "Legal Assistant", "Medical Scribe", etc.
