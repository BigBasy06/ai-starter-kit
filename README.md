## 🚀 What Is This?
This repository is a **clean, unbranded** template of the engine shown above. It provides the "Skeleton" you need to build advanced AI apps without starting from scratch.

### Core Features:
*   **🧠 Multi-Modal Vision:** Drag & Drop images, handwriting, or PDFs. The AI analyzes them instantly.
*   **⚡ Real-Time Streaming:** Text generates token-by-token (No "Loading..." spinners).
*   **🎨 Cyber-Minimalist UI:** Pre-styled CSS that looks professional out of the box.
*   **🧮 Academic Math Engine:** Automatically formats complex equations ($$ x = \frac{-b}{2a} $$) using LaTeX.
*   **🛡️ Public-Safe Auth:** Users must enter their own API Key, making it safe to demo publicly.

## ⚖️ The "Done-For-You" Service
**Most students get stuck on deployment.**
Running it on `localhost` is easy. Deploying it to a live URL (`https://your-project.streamlit.app`) with custom branding and domain logic is hard.

I offer a **Rapid Prototyping Service** to bridge that gap.

| Feature | 🆓 Free Template (This Repo) | ⚡ Paid Service ($99 USD) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Source Code** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **Hosting** | ❌ Localhost Only | ✅ **Live URL Deployment** |
| **Branding** | ❌ Default "Nexus" Theme | ✅ **Your Name/Logo/Colors** |
| **Custom Logic** | ❌ Generic AI Persona | ✅ **Tuned to your Topic (Law/Med)** |
| **Turnaround** | 🐢 Do It Yourself | 🚀 **< 48 Hours** |

### 💼 Who Is This For?
*   **Hackathon Teams** who need a backend *now* so they can focus on the pitch.
*   **FYP Students** who need a polished artifact to show their supervisor.
*   **Non-Technical Founders** validating an idea.
